image: large.pgm # Path to the image file containing the occupancy data; can be absolute, or relative to the location of the YAML file
resolution: 0.01 # Resolution of the map, meters / pixel
origin: [-15.0, -15.0, 0] # The 2-D pose of the lower-left pixel in the map, as (x, y, yaw), with yaw as counterclockwise rotation (yaw=0 means no rotation). Many parts of the system currently ignore yaw. Setting to center right now.
occupied_thresh: 0.80 #  Pixels with occupancy probability greater than this threshold are considered completely occupied.
free_thresh: 0.20 # Pixels with occupancy probability less than this threshold are considered completely free.
negate: 0 # Whether the white/black free/occupied semantics should be reversed (interpretation of thresholds is unaffected)
